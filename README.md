# How to use this repo?

This repository's file organization is up to each athlete, however, keep the following file format for every problem that you upload to Codeforces:
[[O
* `CONTESTID_RANKING.cpp`
  * Where `CONTESTID` is a number that uniquely identifies each contest within Codeforces
  * and `RANKING` is the problem's letter within that contest

For example, if you were to solve [this problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1739/F), you should upload the solutoin with the following name:

* `1739_F.cpp`
* where `1739` tells us that it belongs to **problem F** of [Codeforces's 1739 contest](https://codeforces.com/contest/1739)
